## Py-rex (Pyradiomics extension)ï¼Œ which is developed based on the latest [pyradiomics](https://github.com/Radiomics/pyradiomics).

This is an open-source python package for extension of [pyradiomics](https://github.com/Radiomics/pyradiomics) on both input and output sides.
With this pacakge we aim to allow users to use origial DICOM file (CT/PET/MRI) and RTSTRUCT for radiomics calculation. 

### Features
1. Py-rex is allowed original DICOM files and RTstruture;
2. Internal module for the creation of numeric images and ROI binary mask;
3. Computation of radiomics features on a specific ROI;
4. Semi-automatic approach to handle multiple ROI names;
5. Output radiomics features in different formats such as [Resource Description Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) (RDF)(with related ontologies (e.g., Radiomics Ontology and Radiation Oncology Ontology)) or txt.

### Usage

1. install [pyradiomics](https://github.com/Radiomics/pyradiomics)
2. Clone/Download Py-rex to the sub-directory of pyardiomics
3. Configure files of Pyradiomics and Py-rex are in ./ParamsSettings. 
4. Execute MainScript.py
5. Results in ./RFstore.


	
### Example
We provide two test datasets (CT/MRI) in `./data`.

```
python ./MainScript.py
```
