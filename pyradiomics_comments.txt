Thanks for sharing the repository. 

I don't have a lot of time to look at this now, but you should 
definitely not sort your DICOM files by InstanceNumber - you are not 
at all guaranteed to have a correct geometric order, and 
InstanceNumber can be missing altogether in the input dataset:

This is one example why we don't want to incorporate DICOM parsing in 
the library. It is best done by the tools specifically developed for 
this purpose. Errors like this are very dangerous, since you will have 
absolutely no indication your features are calculated from an 
inconsistent spatial location based on the calculated feature values.
